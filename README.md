# decisiontree
QM 499 Independent Study Project

This is a decision tree program for my independnet study in Quantitative Methods. The program is written in Python. This program is not generalized, so it cannot be used to create any decision tree. It will only create a decision tree for my sample data. To run this program, I used XAMPP. You need to download this repository and save it under the 'htdocs' folder in the xammp folder found on the C drive.
